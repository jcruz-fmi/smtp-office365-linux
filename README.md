## Overview
This guide explains how to configure Postfix and Mailutils on Ubuntu to use an Office 365 email address for sending emails. The process involves installing Postfix and Mailutils, configuring the Postfix settings, creating a file to store the login information, configuring the generic mapping to define the user, and sending a test email.

## Prerequisites

You should have basic knowledge of Linux system administration and the command-line interface. Specifically, you should be comfortable with the following tasks:

- Updating packages and installing software using the apt-get package manager.
- Editing configuration files using a text editor such as Vim or Nano.
- Setting file permissions and ownership using the chmod and chown commands.
- Using Postfix commands such as postmap to update configuration files and check the mail queue.
- Understanding basic email concepts such as SMTP, mail relaying, and authentication.
- Access to an Office 365 email account with valid login credentials, as well as the ability to configure the email account's password if necessary.

Note: This guide was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 but should work on other versions of Ubuntu as well.

You can use your preferred text editor, such as nano, vim, or emacs, in place of vim in the commands below.

## Install Postfix and Mailutils
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postfix mailutils -y
```
## Configure Postfix
```
sudo vim /etc/postfix/main.cf
```
Change the following line:
```
relayhost = smtp.office365.com:587
```
Add the following at the end of the file:
```
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_always_send_ehlo = yes
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```
## Create a file to hold the login info
```
sudo vim /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```
In that file, add the following line, replacing "user@yourdomain" and "password" with your own email address and password:
```
smtp.office365.com:587 user@yourdomain:password
```
## Set file permissions for the password
```
sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```
## Configure the generic mapping to define the user
```
sudo vim /etc/postfix/generic
```
Add the following two lines, replacing "user@domain.com" with your own email address:
```
root@localdomain user@domain.com
@localdomain user@domain.com
```
## Set file permissions for generic
```
sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/generic
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/generic
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/generic
```
## Restart Postfix
```
sudo systemctl restart postfix
```
## Send a test email
```
echo "Test body" | mail -s "Relay Test Email" user@yourdomain.com -a "user@yourdomain.com"
```
## Check the mail queue
```
sudo mailq
```
If you encounter any issues with this setup, please check the mail server logs at `/var/log/mail.log` for more information.
